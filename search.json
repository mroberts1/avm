    "text": "Why Vanishing Point?\nThe name of the site just came to me as I was watching again some of the videos that are collected here. As you will see if you watch some of them, many of them reproduce the classic historical model of one-point perspective, as the camera moves in an infinite zoom towards an endlessly receding central vanishing point. (For examples, simply select the fractal category.)\nIn this respect today’s algorithmic visuals–whether music videos, music visualizers, or a hybrid of the two–resemble the fractal movies that computer artists have been producing for much of the past half century, and which have become an entire YouTube genre in their own right.\n\nVanishing Point is a term from perspective drawing. It is the point in the distance where parallel lines appear to converge. It is a metaphor for the convergence of different disciplines in the creation of algorithmic visual music.\n\n\nThe previous paragraph was in fact auto-suggested to me by the AI writing assistant I use, and I liked it so much I decided to keep it. It’s a good example of how the AI can help you to think about your own work in new ways.\n\nThe previous two paragraphs were in fact both auto-generated by the same AI writing assistant that references itself in the second one. Whether in music, video, writing, or other creative fields, we no longer work alone, but are shadowed by these phantom presences.\nThe purpose of this site is to collect some of what I consider to be among the most innovative examples of contemporary visual music, continuing in algorithmic form creative practices that originate in the musical avant-garde of the 1920s and 1930s, in the work of artists such as Walter Ruttmann and Oscar Fischinger. (Maybe I will post some examples of their work for comparison.) Having begun then with glass plates, wax, and cut out pieces of paper, the convergence of the moving image with music continues today on the screens of algorithmic media; but like so many media forms, the aesthetics of these media do not come out of nowhere, but draw on a rich history. Part of the purpose of this site is to bring that history back into the present. A century after Ruttmann or Fischinger, what new forms of visual music are today’s algorithmic artists creating? Vanishing Point sets out to answer this question.\nMartin Roberts\nSeoul, July 2024\n\n\n\n Back to top"
